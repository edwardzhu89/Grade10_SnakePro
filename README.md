Grade 10 coursework for "Java Projects with GUI"

Description: A Snake AI game, a variation of the traditional Snake game, which involves the user controlling a pixelated snake in a 2D environment. When the snake head touches a food pixel, the length of the snake will increase. If the snake touches itself or the walls, the game is over. My program will also provide an AI mode where the snake can automatically find the food pixels and travel there. This will use BFS (breadth first search) which is a method to find the shortest distance between 2 points. This pathfinding algorithm is used commonly in programs such as in maze solving programs.
